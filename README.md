some real life projects 
PROJECTS 
1. Rock Paper Scissor:

Rock Paper Scissor is one of the
most common games played by
everyone once in his childhood,
where two persons use their hands
and choose random objects between
rock, paper, or scissors, and their
choice decides the winner between
them. What if a single person can
play this game? With a computer,
just by using a single Python
application, we can design the game
Rock Paper Scissor application using
basic Python knowledge like if-else
statements, random value
generation, and input-output of
values. Created application has a
feature where we can play the game,
and maintain the score of Person 1

and Person 2. Choose

2. Simple Calculator:

Simple Calculator is a Python
language-based application used
for performing all the simple
arithmetic operations like addition,
multiplication, division, and
subtraction. The application can be
made using basic knowledge of
Python like if-else statements,
loops, etc. The functionalities of the
application are mentioned below:
1.Addition
2.Subtraction
3.Multiplication
4.Division
5.Logarithmic values
6.Square roots

3. Bank Management

System:

The banking sector occupies a large
part of the tertiary sector because
which data maintained is too much
by a single application. Using
Python language we can create an
application that can manage the
data of the Bank, we use basic
knowledge of Python like string,
list, dictionary, etc.
The functionality of the Bank
Management System Application is
mentioned below:
1.Transfer Money to the Account
2.Creation of Account
3.Check Amount
4.Login Functionality

4. Cricket Score Board:

Cricket second most popular game
in the world. Most Indians are just
crazy about this sport there is
multiple application to check
cricket scores, it is quite a tough job
to maintain a live score of cricket,
but we can create a simple Python
application to display Cricket score,
which we can create using basic
Python knowledge.
The functionality of the Cricket
score display is mentioned below:
1.Print Match Statistics
2.Print runs scored
3.Update score
4.Show results

5. Number Base
Conversion:

Converting numbers from one base to
another is a common question asked
in the field of computers and
electronics. Subjects like digital
electronics, discrete mathematics, etc.
Using Python we can create an
application to convert numbers from
one base to another. It requires basic
knowledge of Python like string,
arithmetic operations, etc.
The functionality of the Number
System Conversion is mentioned
below:
1.Decimal to Binary
2.Binary to Decimal
3.Decimal to Octal
4.Octal to Decimal
5.Hexadecimal to Binary
6.Binary to Hexadecimal
