PROJECTS 
1. Rock Paper Scissor:

Rock Paper Scissor is one of the
most common games played by
everyone once in his childhood,
where two persons use their hands
and choose random objects between
rock, paper, or scissors, and their
choice decides the winner between
them. What if a single person can
play this game? With a computer,
just by using a single Python
application, we can design the game
Rock Paper Scissor application using
basic Python knowledge like if-else
statements, random value
generation, and input-output of
values. Created application has a
feature where we can play the game,
and maintain the score of Person 1

and Person 2. Choose

2. Simple Calculator:

Simple Calculator is a Python
language-based application used
for performing all the simple
arithmetic operations like addition,
multiplication, division, and
subtraction. The application can be
made using basic knowledge of
Python like if-else statements,
loops, etc. The functionalities of the
application are mentioned below:
1.Addition
2.Subtraction
3.Multiplication
4.Division
5.Logarithmic values
6.Square roots



3. Number Base
Conversion:

Converting numbers from one base to
another is a common question asked
in the field of computers and
electronics. Subjects like digital
electronics, discrete mathematics, etc.
Using Python we can create an
application to convert numbers from
one base to another. It requires basic
knowledge of Python like string,
arithmetic operations, etc.
The functionality of the Number
System Conversion is mentioned
below:
1.Decimal to Binary
2.Binary to Decimal
3.Decimal to Octal
4.Octal to Decimal
5.Hexadecimal to Binary
6.Binary to Hexadecimal
